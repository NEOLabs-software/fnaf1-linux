# Five Nights At Freddy's for Linux

### IMPORTANT: no longer maintained

and even worse, npm install process is weird, so dont use it

> This is made using electron and node

fnaf1-Linux is a port of fnaf on HTML code, launched by electron, and controlled using npm.

I do not actually code this port, it is made using GitHub pages. all I did was import it and make it a desktop app using Electron and npm. the og link is [here](https://github.com/sussygamedeveloper/FNAF1)

## install

the installation process is simple

1. clone the repository
2. install the app
```
npm install
```

> Or you can run
```npm i fnaf1-Linux``

 **and after that, fnaf should be installed**
